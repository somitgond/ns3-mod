* Notes regarding custom AQM

1. when queue size at net device is increased (1000), while only
   around 230~ packets are in queue at a time. queue size at traffic
   control is 0.
2. if situation is reversed in above qsize at tc is 1000 and qsize at
   net device is 10 and only 230~ packets are in queue at a time. Then
   tc-qize is around 220~ and net-device-qsize is full the whole time
   i.e 10.

   From above observation I can say that there are two queue size one
   at net device layer and other one at traffic control layer.
   +---------------+
   |traffic control|
   +---------------+
   |Net device     |
   +---------------+

3. If net device queue is set to 0: tc-qsize is 0, but nd-qsize is ~230
4. If I not set nd-qsize, then default nd-qsize is setted as 100
5. when both nd-qsize and tc-qsize is set to 0. tc-qsize remains 0
   while nd-qsize is ~230
   Does 0 means infinite buffer size ? Observation points to that
